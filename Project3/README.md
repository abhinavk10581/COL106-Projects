## 📌 3. Map Navigator with A* Search — `README.md`

```markdown
# 🗺️ Map Navigator with A* Pathfinding

A city-based route planner that computes shortest paths using the A* algorithm with real-world simulation of road types, traffic, and closures.

## 🚀 Features

- A* pathfinding with Euclidean/Manhattan heuristics
- Realistic road types (highway, residential, bridge)
- Traffic simulation and road closure handling
- Dynamic rerouting and path history
- Tkinter GUI for live path visualization

## 🧠 DSA Concepts

- Graph with weighted edges
- A* Algorithm
- Priority Queue (heapq)
- Enum for road and traffic types

## 🖥️ GUI

Built using Tkinter:
- Visualizes graph map
- Interactive path selection and traffic updates

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
python map_navigator.py
